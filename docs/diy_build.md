# DIY Build

To build a breadboard WiFiCom, see [Parts List](parts_list.md) and [Breadboard Layout](picow_breadboard.md).

## Supported Boards

### WiFiCom
- Raspberry Pi Pico W

Note: Arduino Nano Connect, RP2040+AirLift, and screenless WiFiComs are likely to stop working in a future update.

### P-Com (USB serial connection only)
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- Seeed Xiao RP2040
- Other RP2040 boards are likely to work, but you will need to define pins in `board_config.py`

Note: Screen output on P-Coms is likely to stop working in a future update.
