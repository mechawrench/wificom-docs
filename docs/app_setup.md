General instructions for any WiFiCom app. See [w0rld Integration](w0rld_integration.md) for w0rld-specific instructions.

1. Ensure you have completed [Device Setup](device_setup.md)
1. Go to the [API Keys](https://wificom.dev/app-credentials) section on the website
1. Find the entry for the app you wish to use
1. Click **Get New API Key**
1. Return to the app itself
1. When prompted by the app, provide the **API Key** and the **device name of your WiFiCom**
1. If your WiFiCom has a speaker, you should hear a beep when it receives a DigiROM from the app

For apps which only support serial, instead put the WiFiCom into Serial Mode.
