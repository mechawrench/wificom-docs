# Real-Time Battles

We support the following for real-time battles, and these battles happen as if you were really connecting your devices in person.

### Digimon (all devices can battle one another in the list):

- Pendulum X
- Mini (not Xros Mini)
- Accel - choose the "エックス" option ("X", second on the list)
- iC (prongs) - choose the "アクセル" option ("Accel", second on the list)

### Legendz (all devices can battle one another in the list):

- Talispod
- Talisdam - choose "ダム" (Dam) if battling another Talisdam or "ポッド" (Pod) if battling a Talispod

Note when battling Talispod vs Talisdam:

- You need to remove the outer two soul dolls from the Talisdam.
- There can be slight discrepancies in damage reported. This is not a bug in WiFiCom, it happens the same way when connecting devices in person.

## Instructions

- Voice chat is recommended.
- It helps if your first try is with someone who's done it before. While the group is still small, devs are happy to talk you through it on voice chat - please just ask!
- Both players connect their WiFiCom to WiFi.
- Both players navigate to the [Realtime Battles](https://wificom.dev/realtime-battles) area on the WiFiCom website.
- Host goes to "Generate Realtime Battle Code", selects the options, clicks Start, and gives the invite code to guest.
- Guest enters the code in "Accept Realtime Battle" and clicks Start.
- Use the Retry button if your WiFiCom didn't get the message, or if you have to reboot it after getting the message.
- Bright LED means it's waiting for you to press the button.
- For Digimon, host presses the button first and continues to hold the toy against the connector. Guest will get a bright LED and a beep shortly afterwards, and should press the button as soon as possible after this happens.
- For Legendz, both players press the button at about the same time, and continue to hold the toy against the connector. There will be an error visible - ignore this and keep holding, it takes a while.
