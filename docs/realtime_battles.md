# Real-Time Battles

We support the following for real-time battles, and these battles happen as if you were really connecting your devices in person.

### Digimon (all devices can battle one another in the list):

- Pendulum X
- Mini (not Xros Mini)
- Accel - choose the "エックス" option ("X", second on the list)
- iC (prongs) - choose the "アクセル" option ("Accel", second on the list)

### Legendz (all devices can battle one another in the list):

- Talispod
- Talisdam - choose "ダム" (Dam) if battling another Talisdam or "ポッド" (Pod) if battling a Talispod

Note when battling Talispod vs Talisdam:

- You need to remove the outer two soul dolls from the Talisdam.
- There can be slight discrepancies in damage reported. This is not a bug in WiFiCom, it happens the same way when connecting devices in person.

## Initial Test

1. Ensure you have completed [Device Setup](device_setup.md).
1. Navigate to the [WiFiComs](https://wificom.dev/wifi-devices) area on the WiFiCom website and open the page for your WiFiCom.
1. Send a DigiROM to your WiFiCom:
    * Digimon: `X1-0159-4379-2E49-@4009`
    * Talispod: `LT1-117800780015050701010202020242F90004016C-AA780022-AA780022-AA780022`
    * Talisdam: `LT1-125900590006050C02030E0E0E02E389000101000A050504010611050502B6-AA590003-AA590003-AA590003`
1. Try to battle your device with the WiFiCom. For these DigiROMs, prepare the battle up to the connect screen, connect the device prongs, and wait for the battle to start without pressing any buttons.
1. On Legendz, this only accounts for the first round, so return the reborn switch to cancel the battle when your device asks about attacks for round 2.

## Battle Instructions

- Voice chat is recommended.
- It helps if your first try is with someone who's done it before. While the group is still small, devs are happy to talk you through it on voice chat - please just ask!
- Both players connect their WiFiCom to WiFi.
- Both players navigate to the [Realtime Battles](https://wificom.dev/realtime-battles) area on the WiFiCom website.
- Host goes to "Generate Realtime Battle Code", selects the options, clicks Start, and gives the invite code to guest.
- Guest enters the code in "Accept Realtime Battle" and clicks Start.
- Use the Retry button if your WiFiCom didn't get the message, or if you have to reboot it after getting the message.
- Bright LED means it's waiting for you to press the button.
- For Digimon, host presses the button first and continues to hold the toy against the connector. Guest will get a bright LED and a beep shortly afterwards, and should press the button as soon as possible after this happens.
- For Legendz, both players press the button at about the same time, and continue to hold the toy against the connector. There will be an error visible - ignore this and keep holding, it takes a while.
