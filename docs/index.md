## What's a WiFiCom?
- Like a D-Com/A-Com, but controlled via WiFi instead of USB.
    - Premade battery-powered WiFiComs are available, giving freedom from cables!
    - The basic DIY instructions provided on this site are for a WiFiCom powered over micro USB.
- Supports:
    - All Digimon V-Pets currently supported by the D-Com/A-Com
    - Infrared Digimon: iC, Twin, Data Link, Fusion Loader
    - D-Scanner barcodes via infrared
    - Magical Witches
    - Legendz Talispod and Talisdam.
- Apps can connect over WiFi, including w0rld and NacaBattle.
- Serial mode uses USB serial in the same way an A-Com, for use with apps that don't support WiFi yet.
- Punchbag mode provides standalone operation, with configurable DigiROMs.
- Realtime online battles for Pendulum X/Accel/iC/Mini and Legendz Talisdam/Talispod, via the WiFiCom website.
- Open-source server provides an HTTP API for easy app development, including web apps and iOS.
- If you ever wanted to code your own V-Pet, this is a beginner-friendly hardware platform using CircuitPython (or Arduino could be used with more effort and no infrared support).

## First Steps
Obtain a WiFiCom by either building or buying a premade unit from a reputable maker.
